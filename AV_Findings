Issue at hand (really short summary):
Cody Wilson, an aspiring gunsmith, wanted to use Stratsys' 3D Printer to create a 3D pistol. 
However, Stratsys got wind of this plan and immediately seized Wilson's 3D printer. 
Wilson, director of the Wiki Weapon project, had raised $20,000 just for the project and currently trying to get another 3D printer.
